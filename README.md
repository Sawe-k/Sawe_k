## 👨‍💻 About Me

<p>
I am a learner of the ALX <strong>Software Engineering Program</strong> and I’m on an exciting journey to become a professional software engineer and frontend developer.  

✨ Why I started with software engineering:  
- My curiosity about how technology powers the world and my love for problem-solving motivated me to start this path. I’ve always been inspired by how impactful digital solutions can change businesses and people’s lives.  

🔥 What inspires me:  
- Creativity, innovation, and the opportunity to use technology to solve real-world problems. I believe in building solutions that not only function well but also deliver an excellent user experience.  

🎯 My aim is to grow into a skilled developer capable of creating scalable and user-centered applications.  
That’s why I’d like to work on **web applications, open-source contributions, and creative digital projects** that bridge design and functionality.
